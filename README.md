# Namitab

Nami is japanese for wave. This new tab page is inspired by Great Wave off Kanegawa and vaporwave/windows 95 aesthetics.

Go to the live website with the link in the about section on the right hand sidebar.

A personal and mostly just creatively satisfying project. No, your screen isn't glitching out, that's a CSS scanlines effect. Probably not many would like it but I think its cool.

## Search bar functionality:
```
-d [words] : searches duckduckgo for words
-y [words] : searches youtube for words
-l [words] : google searches the liquipedia site for words
-w [words] : searches wikipedia for words
-a [shortcut name] [url] [category] : creates a new shortcut to url labeled name under category
-r [shortcut name] : removes a shortcut labeled name if possible
-s [shortcut name] : goes to shortcut's url
no prefix: google search of whatever is in search bar
```

Although, unless you're me, you won't be able to add or remove shortcuts since I've locked that feature with firebase authentication for obvious reasons.
